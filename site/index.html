	<h3>Chicken</h3>
	<p> This twist on the traditional Asian chicken dish has a very unique flavor, largely due to the use of peanut butter cups as the central flavoring agent. That's right, we created a rich sauce using a blend of soy, rice wine vinegar, seasonings, and chocolate-peanut butter cups.</p>

<div class="beef col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
	<h3>Beef</h3>
	<p>When you're spending this much money on a cut of meat, you want to let it shine with simple but exciting seasonings. Blend coffee, bourbon, and brown sugar for a dark, thick rub that forms a crackly crust. Offset the roast's richness with a refreshing watercress or arugula salad.</p>

<div class="sushi col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-sm-12">
<h3>Sushi</h3>
	<p>For some, it's health food wrapped in its own edible package. For others, it's a fun way to socialize with friends. Still other folks see it as an excuse to eat more wasabi. Whatever the reasons, there's no doubt about it â€“ these days just about everyone loves sushi.</p>
